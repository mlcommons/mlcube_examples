# This MLCube K8S platform configuration file uses n1-standard-4 (4 vCPUs, 15 GB memory) GCP instance with 100 GB
# storage space. In order to use GCP runner, you need to have an account at GCP. Update this file:
#   Use your project ID and zone names.
#   Download your service account JSON key file (credentials.file)
#   Configure you GCP profile so that all newly created instances are deployed with your keys. The GCP runner uses
#       SSH runner to login to remote nodes. Read documentation section in ./ssh.yaml to configure login.
#   GCP runner can automatically create remote instances - see `instance` section below.
#       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#                       GCP RUNNER DOES NOT DELETE GCP INSTANCES
#              ONCE DONE, GO TO GCP CONSOLE AND DELETE INSTANCES MANUALLY
#       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
