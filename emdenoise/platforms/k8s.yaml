# To make K8S runner work (as of 2020-11-28), several actions need to be taken:
#   1. Make sure that `workspace` directory is a persistent volume claim.
#      - Use this file: https://github.com/xyhuang/mlcube_demo/blob/main/k8s/k8s_volume.yaml
#      - Update host path
#      - Execute: `kubectl apply -f k8s_volume.yaml`
#   2. Use run configuration files from this directory: https://github.com/xyhuang/mlcube_demo/tree/main/k8s/run
# In future releases (should be completed by end of 2020), everything will be automated.
