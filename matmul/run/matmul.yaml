# A run configuration assigns values to task parameters. Since there can be multiple run configurations for one
# task (i.e., 1-GPU and 8-GPU training), run configuration files do not necessarily have to have the same name as their
# tasks. Three sections need to be updated in this file - `task_name`, `input_binding` and `output_binding`.
# Users use task configuration files to ask MLCube runtime run specific task using `--task` command line argument.

# Dictionary of input bindings (dictionary mapping strings to strings). Parameters must correspond to those in task
# file (`inputs` section). If not parameters are provided, the binding section must be an empty dictionary.

# Dictionary of output bindings (dictionary mapping strings to strings). Parameters must correspond to those in task
# file (`outputs` section). Every parameter is a file system path (directory or a file name). Paths can be absolute
# (starting with `/`) or relative. Relative paths are assumed to be relative to MLCube `workspace` directory.
# Alternatively, a special variable `$WORKSPACE` can be used to explicitly refer to the MLCube `workspace` directory.
# MLCube root directory (`--mlcube`) and run configuration file (`--task`) define MLCube task to run. One step left is
# to specify where MLCube runs - on a local machine, remote machine in the cloud etc. This is done by providing platform
# configuration files located in the MLCube `platforms` sub-folder.
# NEXT: study `platforms/docker.yaml`.
